extends TextEdit

## An extended TextEdit that overrides the default Tab key behavior.
## Instead of inserting a tab character, it moves focus to the next/previous
## control, making it suitable for forms. It handles both Tab and Shift+Tab.

	# Intercept keyboard events that are not echoes (e.g., from holding a key down).
	if event is InputEventKey and event.is_pressed() and not event.is_echo():

				# If Shift is held, get the focus neighbor configured for "up".

				# Otherwise, get the focus neighbor configured for "down".
				neighbor_path = get_focus_neighbor(Side.SIDE_BOTTOM)
